## Introduction
As a developer I'm always looking for new tools to streamline my workflow. The Awesome Window Manager is my latest experiment. In this post I will explore my  experience with setting it up and doing work with it. I will also compare it to my previous environment.

## Coming from Pop!Os
### A Fully fletched DE
A while ago I made the switch from Windows to Linux on all my machines. After some initial distro hopping I stuck with [Pop!OS](https://pop.system76.com/) (or at least the [Pop!Shell](https://github.com/pop-os/shell)). 

The window management is what really set it apart from anything else I had tried. I quickly fell in love with the **tiling** and **window stacking** functionality. Combining that with the vertical desktops of *Gnome 36* really increased my productivity at work. Using a tiling layout was a real revelation to me. To me it was one of those things that I never gave much thought, but once I had tried and gotten used to it, I could never again live without. 
 
At some point I realized that I wasn't confined to using Ubuntu underneath my beloved *Pop!Shell*. So up until recently I've been using *Arch + Pop!Shell*.

## Going WM only
