  My personal journey from...

- ... a regular full - size 104 key to a 39 key.  
  - ... QWERTY to Workman
  - ... standard keymap to custom QMK
    - ... wired QMK to wireless ZMK
      - ... normie to power user 
## Introduction
I would like to share my experiences, pitfalls and realizations about the world of custom - and in particular ergonomic - keyboards.At times it was definitely not easy to find the information I needed.So maybe this can be helpful for somebody out there. 

## First Custom Keyboard

  This bad boy was my first step into the rabbit role.At first picking all the individual parts was kinda overwhelming.So this seemed like an ok compromise.It was hot - swappable, which was great since I had no clue what kinds of switches I liked.

The only other mechanical keyboard I had ever owned before this - like many young lost souls - was a * Razer Blackwidow * and I just accepted the clicky switches that were inside of it.To be honest I haven't really gone deep on boutique switches and all the mystique around it but I did some exploration.

## Picking Switches
I first ordered the * GMMK * with * Gateron Clears * which proved to be too light of a spring for me. 
Since I couldn't get my hand on any high quality lube, I tried spray lubing them. That turned out to be a huge mistake because half the switches ended up no longer functional. Maybe I just didn't do it right.

Being left unsatisfied with * Gateron Clears * I ordered a selection of different types of switches - mostly linears and tactiles, mostly Gaterons due to the pricepoint.I don't wanna dive too deep but the end result was me sticking with *Gateron Reds* to this day. I would day for any newcomer to this world it's a good starting point to get a hotswap board and a selection of switches(only need to buy about 30 of a kind to fill up alphas + space etc.) and try em out.That's really the only way to find your preference if you're completely unsure.
